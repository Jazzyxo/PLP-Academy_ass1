#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
-Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.

-Software Engineering is important since it enables the creation of software applications and systems promoting innovation.
-Software Engineering ensures that systems and data are protected from cyber threats since it ensures security considerations.
-Software Engineering ensures that systems are scalable and can adapt to the ever evolving needs of others.
-Software Engineering creates systems that are reliable and can be used by any average person in the world.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  
-The development of programming languages such as Fortnan and C
-The establishment of software engineering in the 1960s
-The rise of agile methodologies

3.List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements which is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-Design which is creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-Implementation which involves writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
-Testing is where tests are conducted to ensure code meets quality standards.
-Deployment involves releasing the software to users or customers.
-Maintenance is providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   ## Comparison

| **Aspect** | **Waterfall** | **Agile** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Client involvement | Mainly at the beginning and end | Continuous throughout the project |
| Deliverables | One final product | Incremental releases |
| Documentation | Comprehensive | Minimal, as needed |
| Testing | After development phase | Continuous |

## Appropriate Scenarios

### Waterfall:

- Projects with well-defined, stable requirements
- Highly regulated industries with strict documentation needs (e.g., healthcare, government)
- Projects with fixed budgets and timelines
- Example: Developing software for a nuclear power plant control system

### Agile:

- Projects with evolving or unclear requirements
- Fast-paced industries where quick adaptation is crucial (e.g., startups, web applications)
- Projects that benefit from frequent user feedback
- Example: Developing a mobile app for a social media platform

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer uses programming to create and maintain software and ensures overall functionality.
-A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software products meet specified quality standards and functional requirements.
-A project manager is responsible for the planning , execution and deliverying of the the project on during the required time

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples are Visual Studio and Eclipse.
-VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. Examples are Git and Subversion.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-Tight deadlines. When dealing with a tight deadline first you must divide the task among the members of the team and complete the biggest tasks first, always set mini deadlines to help keep track of the progress and always ensure there is communication between all team members.
-Changing requirements.To deal with this adopt the use of agile methodologies to accommodate changes throughout the developing process, ensure the software is scalable making it easier to adapt to changes, also ensure there is a change management process in place for such occassions and conduct testing to ensure changes are working well.

  8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  -Unit Testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
  -Integration Testing is the testing of interactions between difference components or subsystems.
  -System testing is testing the entire software system as a whole
  - Acceptance testing is the testing of software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
     Testing is important because:
 - Ensures the system meets business requirements and user needs
- Validates the system's usability from an end-user perspective
- Helps in determining if the system is ready for deployment

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
   Prompt engineering is the process of crafting and refining natural language prompts in a way that optimizes the performance of AI models.

   Importance
 Model Performance: Well-crafted prompts can significantly improve the accuracy and effectiveness of AI models. By providing explicit instructions and context, prompts guide the model's interpretation and prediction.
Control over AI Output: Prompt engineering allows users to fine-tune the AI's responses and control its behavior. By modifying the phrasing, grammar, or tone of the prompt, users can influence the output to align with their desired outcomes.
Communication Bridge: Prompts serve as a communication bridge between humans and AI models. They allow users to convey their intentions, provide additional information, and clarify expectations.
Human-AI Collaboration: Effective prompt engineering facilitates collaboration between humans and AI models. Users can iteratively refine prompts based on the AI's responses, fostering a feedback loop that improves the overall experience.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
   "Help me with the application" is a vague promot while "Write a cover letter template for an internship in a software development company". It is improved in that it is concise in what you want by saying cover letter template, it is clear and it understands that this is for an internship so it can be more specific.
